# GitHub Copilot Agent Mode Frontend POC

This repository is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** for testing techniques to use GitHub Copilot Agent Mode at its best. The goal is to build a **mortgage calculator** in a quick and solid way, leveraging the power of GitHub Copilot Agent Mode for rapid development.

## Tech Stack

- **Svelte 5** - Modern reactive framework
- **SvelteKit** - Full-stack Svelte framework
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and enhanced developer experience
- **ESLint** - Code linting
- **Prettier** - Code formatting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)

### Installation

Dependencies are already installed. If you need to reinstall them:

```sh
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

### Code Quality

Format code:

```sh
npm run format
```

Lint code:

```sh
npm run lint
```

Type check:

```sh
npm run check
```

## Project Goal

This POC aims to demonstrate how GitHub Copilot Agent Mode can accelerate the development of a functional mortgage calculator web application, showcasing:

- Rapid prototyping with modern web technologies
- Type-safe development with TypeScript
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Responsive user interface design
